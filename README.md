# QuickSoft

QuickSoft is an application designed to perform intensive processing tasks efficiently. To improve performance, we use the Python 'multiprocessing' module, which allows us to take advantage of the 4 CPU cores, significantly reducing the execution time.

## Features

- **Multiprocessing**: Uses 4 cores to divide the work and speed it up.
- **Modularity**: Easy to extend and modify for different types of processing.
- **Compatibility**: Works on any operating system that supports Python.
